 *   Due to extensive use of the N-word throughout the source code, it has been
 *   decided to replace some occurences with REDACTED. This decision was made in
 *   particular due to the racial nature of the insult which could be easily taken
 *   the wrong way. Aside from that, fuck you and kill yourself, I can still insult
 *   your fatass all I want regardless and you are not getting away any time soon.
 *   Fuck bullshit censorship, you are all cunts and I hate you :3
